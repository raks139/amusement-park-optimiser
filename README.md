# amusement-park-optimiser
A program which can be implemented as an app for managing crowd and time at an amusement park. Through this app one gets book slots for rides simultaneously while standing in other queues. This way you can save time and energy. This is a very basic prototype and has a lot of scope for improvement. :)
